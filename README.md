# Requirements

* [Zola 0.9](https://www.getzola.org)

# Usage

Just run the `rebuild.sh` script which will build the static site using Zola. Then you need to push at least the `master` branch and wait for a couple of seconds before GitHub publishes on [https://technocreatives.github.io/](https://technocreatives.github.io/).

# TODO

Use GitHub Actions to publish on pushing on the `source` branch once we have GitHub Actions enabled for the organisation.
