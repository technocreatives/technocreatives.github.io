  <h1 class="page-title">Portfolio</h1>
  <p>We understand that assignments are time consuming and that some people have built up significant portfolios of code that can be used to demonstrate competence. You may choose to submit a portfolio of your code in place of doing one of the listed assignments.</p>
<p>Your portfolio can include code from assignments you have done for other companies, personal projects, or professional projects.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="accepted-languages">Accepted languages</h3>
<p>These are the languages we tend to use to implement new solutions here at the Techno Creatives, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Swift</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
</ul>
<p>We also sometimes have to work with, and accept and can review any codebases written in the following languages, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no penalty associated with supplying a portfolio in any language listed above.</p>
<p>If the language your project is written in is not listed here, we can unfortunately not accept it as we would not be able to competently assess the quality of the given codebases.</p>
<h3 id="project-types">Project types</h3>
<p>Please select 1 to 3 projects that demonstrate any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An iOS or Android apps that you have developed</li>
<li>A web frontend or backends that you have developed</li>
<li>A game or 'app' developed in Unity or a similar 'game' development engine</li>
<li>Any other command line tools, embedded code, or similar</li>
<li>An assignments from another companies you have completed that you think demonstrate something useful that we could assess</li>
</ul>
<p>Your projects may all be of the same criteria (ie, you could submit 3 Android apps) or a mix of criteria, at your discretion.</p>
<p>Your submitted projects may be in any number of languages that are in our &quot;Accepted languages&quot; list.</p>
<p>The codebases should be of reasonable size, but should be no less than 250 lines of code in any given language. For large projects, you are welcome to point us to areas you find particularly interesting and that you want use to look at specifically.</p>
<h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission requirements</h3>
<p>For each item submitted, we would like documentation of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem is the code designed to solve? (max 200 words)</li>
<li>Why did you implement your solution the way you did? (max 500 words)</li>
<li>How to build and run the code in order to assess it, or any other method of testing it</li>
<li>Any known issues we should be aware of when assessing the code (i.e. bugs, identified areas of technical debt, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This information may be provided in a README in the code repository or as part the email providing the links to said repositories.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-criteria">Assessment criteria</h2>
<p>We will assess your submission based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the client's needs as described</li>
<li>If applicable, implementing a cohesive solution of a frontend and backend</li>
<li>Quality of data processing mechanisms (i.e., how databases are accessed, how data is parsed, etc.)</li>
<li>Structuring and architecture of the codebase</li>
<li>Idiomatic/easy to understand usage of languages/frameworks</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are not assessed or otherwise penalised in any way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code testing</li>
<li>If applicable, how the frontend looks (only how it is structured)</li>
<li>Minor bugs in the functionality of your solution</li>
<li>Usage of any particular APIs or frameworks</li>
<li>Little mistakes, typos, etc.</li>
<li>Sending us any questions or comments via email</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>
<p>If we determine that the portfolio does not meet our assessible criteria, we will request that you 
do one of our assignments.</p>
